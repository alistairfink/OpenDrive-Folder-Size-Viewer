# OpenDrive Folder Size Viewer

This is a very basic CLI that given a folder ID and a valid login into the OpenDrive service utilises the OpenDrive APIs to iterate through all subfolders within the given folder. This will return the total folder size in MB.

I wrote this application as a way to verify my files uploaded properly to the service. Since OpenDrive doesn't show folder sizes my only option was to use their APIs to iterate through the folder.
